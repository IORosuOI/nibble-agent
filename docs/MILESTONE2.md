## 0. Architecture overview
<!-- BEGIN 0 (Luca) -->

_TODO: system diagram (Mermaid) and a short walkthrough of one request, from profile to recipe card._

<!-- END 0 -->

## 1. Problem and data
<!-- BEGIN 1 (Răzvan) -->
<!-- What task does the system handle? Which datasets (RecipeNLG, web recipes, USDA, Open Food Facts) and why? How are NEW datasets ingested (common recipe schema, accepted formats, pipeline steps)? -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 1 -->

## 2. Golden dataset
<!-- BEGIN 2 (Vlad) -->
<!-- How are representative test cases and expected answers created? Size, format, categories (normal, edge, adversarial), how expected answers are checked (constraints, not exact text), who reviews them. Which metrics run on it? -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 2 -->

## 3. RAG design
<!-- BEGIN 3 (Mihai) -->
<!-- Chunking strategy, embedding model, vector database, metadata filtering, RAG approaches to compare (e.g. dense vs hybrid, reranking, query rewriting). Explain WHY for each choice. -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 3 -->

## 4. Agent and tools
<!-- BEGIN 4 (Luca) -->
<!-- Which decisions the agent makes vs fixed pipeline steps, the list of tools (inputs/outputs), how they are exposed through the MCP server, agent framework. -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 4 -->

## 5. Model choices
<!-- BEGIN 5 (Marius) -->
<!-- SLMs considered and why (size, tool calling, license, hardware). Fine-tuning plan: method (LoRA), training data, task format, when it happens. -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 5 -->

## 6. Safety: toxicity and hallucinations
<!-- BEGIN 6 (Marius) -->
<!-- Allergen checks, poisonous/inedible blocklist, cooking temperatures and times, nutrition thresholds (50% / 150%), output moderation, grounding. -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 6 -->

## 7. Plan
<!-- BEGIN 7 (Luca) -->
<!-- Week-by-week timeline from week 6 to week 14, per member, including the experiments planned. This is a commitment, reviewed in week 12 via commit history. -->

_TODO_

<!-- END 7 -->
